# My-Thesis-Project
### Overview
In this work, I focused on the use of deep learning algorithms for a pixel-wise segmentation of various plaque components in the carotid artery. The benefit of this study would be to gain a further understanding and to assess the influence of plaque components on its stability. This project was developed relying on Tensorflow and Python using sometimes keras and other other wrapper libraries. Exvivo and Invivo MRI scans from patients were used for the following main objectives:
- To develop a fully automatic technique to achieve state of the art in segmenting plaque components namely; lumen and vessel wall etc...
- To make reproducible the segmentation results to delineate and analyze plaque components.
