# My-Thesis-Project
### Overview

MRI scans from 70 patients were used to learn to automatically segment
the 3D volume of scans, and therefore spatially identify the outlines of
the central gland (CG) and peripheral zone (PZ).

The aim of this project was to quickly establish a benchmark model,
with minimal / lightweight code, only relying on core TensorFlow and
Python, i.e. without using Keras or other wrapper libraries.
